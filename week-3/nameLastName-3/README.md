## C++ White belt
This repository contains my solutions to tasks from week 3 of [C++ course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-plus-plus-yellow/home/welcome)

### Names and last names - 3
Add a constructor to the Person class from the Names and Surnames - 2 task that allows you to specify the person's first and last name at birth, as well as the year of birth. The class should not have a default constructor.

Upon receipt of a year less than the year of birth:

- the GetFullName and GetFullNameWithHistory methods must return "No person";
- the ChangeFirstName and ChangeLastName methods must ignore the request.

In addition, it is necessary to declare const all methods that are in fact them.
