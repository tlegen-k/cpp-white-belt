## C++ White belt

This repository contains my solutions to tasks from [C++ course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-plus-plus-white/home/welcome)
 
## Course description
This course is about introducing the C ++ programming language. You will learn how to use its basic constructions, create your own data types, break the program into classes and functions.
At the end of the course, a final project awaits you: you can independently implement a simple data warehouse with the ability to add, delete and search.

The course was developed by leading experts of Yandex and teachers of the School of Data Analysis. Behind them are the years of development of search services, advertising and infrastructure.

The course is part of the specialization "The Art of Development in Modern C ++".
Tasks cover various introductory topic in C++ like functions, containers, algorithms, classes, operator overloading, exceptions, etc.
BTW, course is taught in russian.
